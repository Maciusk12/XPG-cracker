Welcome to the XPG Cracker 1.0!
It is only Windows compatible (for now)
It can be used to perform a dictionary password attack on pages
For now you can perform the atack on the page.py - to use it on other pages, you have to modify the source code

How to use it?
1. Open up the terminal or powershell
2. Make sure you have python installed
3. To launch it make sure you are in the same directory as the script
4. Use python cracker.py to start the menu
5. Choose all the parameters - the page, the username, the wordlist, and the amount of workers
6. Wait for it to find it, it'll print out the password when it'll find it

USE IT ONLY ON YOUR PRIVATE NETWORKS
